/*
	A color has 3 components: red, green, and blue.
	
	Make a structure 'Color' that will hold the data of a primitive color (3 bits).
	Example: RED -> 100 / GREEN -> 010 / BLUE -> 001.

	Make a function that prints the name of a given Color.
	
	Make a function that takes a Color and returns the opposite Color.
	
	Make a function that fuses a Color with a second Color 
	and a function that removes a Color from a Color.
