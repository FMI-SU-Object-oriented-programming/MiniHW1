/*
	A monthly calendar has 12 months.

	Make a structure 'Calendar' that will have a month (enum)
	and a year (pick a fitting type).
	
	Make a function that prints a calendar's month and year.
	
	Make functions that take a calendar and print the next and previous month and/or year
	(Make use of the previous function).

	Make functions that save and load a calendar to a text file in the format:
	{year} {month}
	where both 'year' and 'month' are integer values.
	// Note: This hasn't been covered in class yet,
	// but you can do some research about the library 'fstream'
	// as it is what we will be using going forward :)
